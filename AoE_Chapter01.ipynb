    "Did you know that the panel controls and cabinet hardware of an instrument may cost more than the electronics inside? The Art of Electronics equips readers to construct powerful, elegant, yet inexpensive, little gadgets to do almost any conceivable task. It keeps mathematics to a minimum to foster a good intuitive understanding of circuit design and behavior. On this foundation, build *active circuits* with amplifiers, oscillators, logic circuits, etc.\n",

    "*Voltage and current*\n",
    "\n",
    "The two quantities that we want to keep track of in electronic circuits are voltage and current. These are usually time-varying, which is an indicator of electricity being harnessed to perform useful and interesting tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving a mass uphill requires energy and downhill movement releases energy that can be harnessed to get work done. In general, uphill is the direction from a point of lower potential to a point of higher potential. In an electrical circuit, voltage represents potential. It is usually represented by the symbol 'V' with unit of measure being volts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an electrical circuit as an obstacle track for electrical charge. The flow of electrical charge is current. It is usually represented by the symbol 'I' with unit of measure being amperes. The charge itself has unit of measure coulomb. Being the rate of flow, current is coulombs per second and usually expressed in amperes.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the nature of these entities, voltage is always *across* two points and current is *at* a point. When we refer to voltage *at a point* in a circuit, we implicitly refer to the second point as the *datum* or ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "The physical realization of a circuit has electrical components that are connected together by wires made of metallic conductors. Any continuous length of wire has the same voltage anywhere on it with respect to, say, ground. This may not be strictly true but is a good approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The engineering drawing of a circuit may not look anything like the physical circuit because wires can be rearranged. It is helpful to think of a circuit as a network graph with junctions as nodes and electrical components as edges. This is the format in which we present a circuit to simulation software.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some simple rules about voltage and current. Imagine going for a walk and returning to the starting point. Some sections of the walk may be uphill and others downhill. Having returned to the starting poing, the sum of all the *ups* and *downs* is exactly zero! So also, **the sum of t he voltage drops in any closed circuit is zero**. This is *Kirchoff's voltage law*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, *Kirchoff's current law* states that **the sum of currents into a point in a circuit equals the sum of currents out**. This is the law of conservation of charge. These two laws help describe a DC circuit (with a DC voltage source, like a battery) in mathematical equations for circuit analysis, to know the voltage or current at a probe point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Components connected in parallel (**Fig 1.1**) must have the same voltage across them. Can you see how this follows from Kirchoff's laws?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 1.1](Assets/AoE_1_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Circle back to the discussion about energy release going downhill. The energy must be dissipated somehow. Think about lightning, which is electrical charge discharged from clouds. High potential is generated by friction between clouds and builds up until the difference in potential with ground (literally!) breaks down the resistance of the atmosphere. The energy is dissipated as a pressure wave that we hear as a loud thunderclap. Enough energy may remain to damage trees and property and cause bodily harm. \n",
    "\n",
    "In an electrical circuit, we dissipate energy safely and in a controlled manner to get work done by a machine. The simplest way to do that is using a resistor. As the name suggests, a resistor provides resistance to the flow of current so that energy is dissipated as heat. How much power do we need to dissipate? The power, P, work per unit time, is product of the voltage, V, work per unit charge, and current, I, charge per unit time.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = VI\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Seen in this way, resistance may seem like a nuisance, but so is friction and without it we wouldn't even be able to walk! Resistors are available in a variety (**Fig 1.2**).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 1.2](Assets/AoE_1_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Power may go into mechanical work (motors), radiated energy (lamps, radio transmitters), or stored energy (batteries, capacitor). We can harness energy in many ways with an electrical cicruit. The name of the game is always to get the desired I-versus-V characteristics. The basic building blocks are resistors (I simply proportional to V), capacitors (I proportional to the rate of change of V), inductors (V proportional to the rate of change of I), diodes (I flows in only one direction), thermisters (temperature-dependent resistor), photoresistors (light-dependent resistor), strain gauges (strain-dependent resistor) and more exotic devices. The resistor is a good place to start."
