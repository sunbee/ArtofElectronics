    "## INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you know that the panel controls and cabinet hardware of an instrument may cost more than the electronics inside? The Art of Electronics equips readers to construct powerful, elegant, yet inexpensive, little gadgets to do almost any conceivable task. It keeps mathematics to a minimum to foster a good intuitive understanding of circuit design and behavior. On this foundation, build *active circuits* with amplifiers, oscillators, logic circuits, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## VOLTAGE, CURRENT AND RESISTANCE\n",
    "\n",
    "*Voltage and current*\n",
    "\n",
    "The two quantities that we want to keep track of in electronic circuits are voltage and current. These are usually time-varying, which is an indicator of electricity being harnessed to perform useful and interesting tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving a mass uphill requires energy and downhill movement releases energy that can be harnessed to get work done. In general, uphill is the direction from a point of lower potential to a point of higher potential. In an electrical circuit, voltage represents potential. It is usually represented by the symbol 'V' with unit of measure being volts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an electrical circuit as an obstacle track for electrical charge. The flow of electrical charge is current. It is usually represented by the symbol 'I' with unit of measure being amperes. The charge itself has unit of measure coulomb. Being the rate of flow, current is coulombs per second and usually expressed in amperes.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the nature of these entities, voltage is always *across* two points and current is *at* a point. When we refer to voltage *at a point* in a circuit, we implicitly refer to the second point as the *datum* or ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "The physical realization of a circuit has electrical components that are connected together by wires made of metallic conductors. Any continuous length of wire has the same voltage anywhere on it with respect to, say, ground. This may not be strictly true but is a good approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The engineering drawing of a circuit may not look anything like the physical circuit because wires can be rearranged. It is helpful to think of a circuit as a network graph with junctions as nodes and electrical components as edges. This is the format in which we present a circuit to simulation software.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some simple rules about voltage and current. Imagine going for a walk and returning to the starting point. Some sections of the walk may be uphill and others downhill. Having returned to the starting poing, the sum of all the *ups* and *downs* is exactly zero! So also, **the sum of t he voltage drops in any closed circuit is zero**. This is *Kirchoff's voltage law*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, *Kirchoff's current law* states that **the sum of currents into a point in a circuit equals the sum of currents out**. This is the law of conservation of charge. These two laws help describe a DC circuit (with a DC voltage source, like a battery) in mathematical equations for circuit analysis, to know the voltage or current at a probe point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Components connected in parallel (**Fig 1.1**) must have the same voltage across them. Can you see how this follows from Kirchoff's laws?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 1.1](Assets/AoE_1_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Circle back to the discussion about energy release going downhill. The energy must be dissipated somehow. Think about lightning, which is electrical charge discharged from clouds. High potential is generated by friction between clouds and builds up until the difference in potential with ground (literally!) breaks down the resistance of the atmosphere. The energy is dissipated as a pressure wave that we hear as a loud thunderclap. Enough energy may remain to damage trees and property and cause bodily harm. \n",
    "\n",
    "In an electrical circuit, we dissipate energy safely and in a controlled manner to get work done by a machine. The simplest way to do that is using a resistor. As the name suggests, a resistor provides resistance to the flow of current so that energy is dissipated as heat. How much power do we need to dissipate? The power, P, work per unit time, is product of the voltage, V, work per unit charge, and current, I, charge per unit time.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = VI\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Seen in this way, resistance may seem like a nuisance, but so is friction and without it we wouldn't even be able to walk! Resistors are available in a variety (**Fig 1.2**).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 1.2](Assets/AoE_1_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Power may go into mechanical work (motors), radiated energy (lamps, radio transmitters), or stored energy (batteries, capacitor). We can harness energy in many ways with an electrical cicruit. The name of the game is always to get the desired I-versus-V characteristics. The basic building blocks are resistors (I simply proportional to V), capacitors (I proportional to the rate of change of V), inductors (V proportional to the rate of change of I), diodes (I flows in only one direction), thermisters (temperature-dependent resistor), photoresistors (light-dependent resistor), strain gauges (strain-dependent resistor) and more exotic devices. The resistor is a good place to start."

In the next part, let us use the simulation results to answer this question. \n",

    "Note the characteristic \"knee-bend\" in the *forward-bias* region with positive voltage and the *reverse-bias* region with negative voltage. The zener diode is one type of diode among others that have the property of clipping voltage at threshold. A regular diode is used in forward-biased mode as a \"one-way street\" for current. We shall observe this in a subsequent simulation. A regular diode's behavior in the knee-bend region in reverse-biased configuration is unpredicatable, except in case of zener diode. In fact, zener diode is used primarily in reverse-biased mode for this reason. Let's proceed to see the zener diode in action in voltage divider (**Fig 1.16**).\n",

    "TLC372 isn't among the parts in the library (above). We can add components. We need the PSPICE model as text file. Vendors like Texas Instruments make these available for download free from the web. For example:\n",

    "Download and save the file to the current directory (i.e. location of this Python script). I have changed the extension to .lib. (E.g. from 'TLC372.5_1' to 'TLC372.lib'. Use the circuit's ```include()``` method with the file to load the model. Then, include in the netlist with the ```X()``` method, passing parameters as per the interface. \n",

    "This very helpfully tells us the interface to use to wire the component. The comparator needs 5 connections in the order specified: non-inverting input, inverting input, positive power supply, negative power supply, output. It also tells us that the name to use to specify the subcircuit in the netlist is 'TLC372'.\n",

    "There are many time-varying signals of interest and the sinusoid is one among them. The sinusoid describes many phenomena in nature as well as the property of a class of *linear* circuits, so called because the output when driven by the sum on input signals is equal to the sum of outputs when driven by each individual signal. A little easier to wrap the head around than Bilbo Baggins' birthday quote, “I don't know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.”\n",

    "What do we need time-varying signals for? Two primary reasons, transfer of power  and transfer of information. In the *war of the currents*, we discussed why the transmission and distribution of power over cables uses AC. The voltage supply in North America is 117 V RMS at 60 Hz, RMS being the steady voltage that yields the equivalent power as the time-varying voltage. For a sinusoid, $V_{RMS} = (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})A$, so that the amplitude is 165 V (or 350 V peak-peak). \n",

    "The transfer of information over air by radio also uses sinusoidal signals. A signal may be observed in a domain other than time domain, such as the frequency domain. There is wonderfully intuitive explanation of the technique of *Fourier Transform* developed by mathematician Fourier to switch between time and frequency domains in this [video](https://youtu.be/ds0cmAV-Yek) based on Doga's [blog](https://bilimneguzellan.net/fuyye-serisi/) in Turkish. It reveals the idea that a time-varying signal can be sculpted in any desired form with a collection of sinusoidal waves of differing amplitude and frequency, so that in general, information can be encoded for transmission at the transmitter and decoded at the receiver. Fourier's mathematical development gives the tools for encoding and decoding.\n",

    "*Signal amplitudes and decibels*\n",

    "How to compare the relative amplitude of two signals? The comparison is based on orders of magnitude of a ratio. One order of magnitude is the ratio 10:1. That is the equivalent of 1 Bel or 10 decibels. Two orders of magnitude is the ratio 100:1, that is 2 Bels or 20 dB. Note the shorthand for decibels is dB. Three orders of magnitude is the ratio 1000:1, that is 30 dB. What if the ratio is 20? Then the math works out as follows:\n",

    "20:1 = 2 \\times 10 = 3\\: dB + 10\\: dB = 13\\: dB \n",
    "$$\n",
    "The little secret here is the ratio 2:1 is 3 dB. The formal definition of a decibel is the logarithm of the ration to base 10. Usage of decibles comes in handy as it converts multiples into addition. Per the formal definition:\n",

    "Use 1N4002G from diodes.com under section for [Standard Rectifiers](https://www.diodes.com/assets/Spice-Models/Discrete-Prodcut-Groups/Standard-Rectifiers.txt). The approach is to wrap the model in a named subcircuit that exposes pins to interface with the outside world. The wrapper has the format:\n",
    "```\n",
    ".SUBCKT <SNAME> <NODE1> <NODE2> <NODE3>\n",

    "Here, SNAME is the name by which the device shall be known. The numbered node identifiers represent the pins to make circuit connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the wrapper, the subcircuit is defined as a netlist. It may be a netlist of only one or multiple devices. In defining the netlist, a device model is defined with the .MODEL keyword. In the example on the NgSpice [page](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/modelparams.html), the netlist has defined a diode (symbol 'D') as 'DbodyMOD' for use in the subcircuit 'FDS86252'. The definition of 'DbodyMOD' is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ".MODEL DbodyMOD D (IS=2.5e-12 n=1.05 RS=7e-3 TRS1=7.5e-3 TRS2=1e-6\n",

    "```\n",
    "This device is used in the subcircuit FDS86252 as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Dbody 7 5 DbodyMOD\n",
    "```\n",
    "The scheme is:\n",
    "```\n",
    ".SUBCKT FDS86252 2 1 3\n",
    "Dbody 7 5 DbodyMOD\n",

    "...\n",
    ".ENDS\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, the subcircuit 'FDS86252' can be used as a device in a netlist with the specfied pin-out.
